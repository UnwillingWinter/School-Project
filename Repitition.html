Visscom describes the Principle of Repetition as the following:
<br>
“ The principle of repetition simply means the reusing of the same or similar elements throughout your design. Repetition of certain design elements in a design will bring a clear sense of unity, consistency, and cohesiveness.
<br>
REPITITION is the use of similar or connected pictorial elements.  For example, similar shapes, colours or lines that are used more than once.  
<br>
REPETITION can be regular or irregular and even or uneven. 
<br>
REPETITION can be in the form of RADIATION where the repeated elements spread out from a central point. REPETITION may be in the form of GRADATION where the repeated elements slowly become smaller or larger.
<br>
Repetition works with pattern to make the artwork seem active. The repetition of elements of design creates unity within the artwork.
<br>
Patterns often occur in nature, and artists use similar repeated motifs to create pattern in their work. Pattern increases visual excitement by enriching surface interest. ”
